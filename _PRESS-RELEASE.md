There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Most Popular Streamers on Twitch

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  The audience is people who quickly want to find the most popular streamers on Twitch.tv in a given timeframe.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  The product is a website that will use the Twitch.tv API to get the most popular streamers on Twitch.tv over a given timeframe. 
  Popularity will be based on the average viewer count every X minutes over a given time frame (since this project is a two day project, the given timeframe will have to be less than two days, but the idea is that the website can show the streamers with the highest average viewer count each month). 
  There will be a list of the most popular streamers for all games, and also for specific games.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  When entering in Google Search the phrase "most popular streamers on twitch," there is no website (in the first three pages at least) that shows the most popular streamers for multiple games on Twitch.tv based on average viewer count. There may be some people who are curious about this statistic, so this website will show them this information.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  The website will continuously check every X minutes for a streamer's viewer count, then average this viewer count over the alotted time period.
  By doing this, it will determine the most popular streamers and show it to the website visitor.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "This website is so pointless."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Not easy at all.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Why did I go to this website?"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
